# eugene
A tribute to T-Bone's Eugene (Watch Dogs Bad Blood).
This project was started two years ago, at it's been untouched for a year and it's not finished yet. A lot of things happened in between. Now, with a few different tools, it's time to finish it.
It's a dream since I was a child, build my how RC Car.

## Installation

### Requirements
##### Software
* Arduino 1.8.5+
* Android 7+

##### Hardware
* I got and old RC car with motor and battery
* NodeMCU
* Android Smartphone with WI-FI working

## Usage
Projects are not compiled so, open them with you favorites IDE's (Arduino IDE and Android Studio, for example) and compile them. NodeMCU does not work like arduino by default but it's possible to do it. Do a research on the internet and upload a simple sketch to try. When working upload the code.

## Wiring
(To be added)
